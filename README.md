# Phase 3 -WK3 - Code Challenge: Articles - with database

#### Date, 2024/06/09

#### BY LESLIE WAMBUI MWANGI


In this code challenge, you will be working with a Magazine domain.

We have three models: `Author`, `Article`, and `Magazine`.

For our purposes, an `Author` has many `Article`s, a `Magazine` has many
`Article`s, and `Article`s belong to both `Author` and `Magazine`.

`Author` - `Magazine` is a many to many relationship.

**Note**: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard _before you
start coding_. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
